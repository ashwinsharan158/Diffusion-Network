# Diffusion-Network
This approach refines low-resolution images (CIFAR-10) using diffusion networks. It iteratively improves image representations, capturing details despite limited pixels. Even with lower resolution, object recognition and classification are enhanced, demonstrating diffusion networks' ability to handle diverse image quality.
